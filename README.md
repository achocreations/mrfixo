## Backlog
### High Priority
These features are essential for enhancing user experience and driving engagement. They provide significant value with relatively low to moderate implementation complexity.
1. **Service Provider Availability Scheduling**
- Impact: High (Improves booking efficiency, reduces conflicts)
- Effort: Moderate
- Reason: Ensures that users can book services when providers are available, reducing frustration and improving the overall booking experience.

2. **In-App Wallet**

- Effort: Moderate to High
- Reason: Simplifies payment processing and offers a convenient way to manage transactions, fostering loyalty through potential cashback or rewards.

3. **Loyalty Program**
- Impact: High (Increases customer retention)
- Effort: Moderate
- Reason: Encourages repeat bookings and boosts customer loyalty, which is crucial for the long-term success of the app.

4. **Referral Program**
- Impact: High (User acquisition, organic growth)
- Effort: Low to Moderate
- Reason: Drives new user acquisition at a low cost, leveraging existing users to bring in more customers.

### Medium Priority
These features enhance the app's functionality and user experience but can be developed after the high-priority items.

1. **Ratings & Certifications for Service Providers**
- Impact: Moderate (Builds trust, improves decision-making)
- Effort: Moderate
- Reason: Helps customers make informed choices and motivates providers to maintain high standards.

2. **Service Bundles and Offers**
- Impact: Moderate (Increases average transaction value)
- Effort: Moderate
- Reason: Encourages users to purchase multiple services, boosting revenue.

3. **Multi-Language Support**
- Impact: Moderate (Increases accessibility)
- Effort: Moderate
- Reason: Expands the user base by catering to non-English speakers, enhancing user inclusivity.

4. **Service History & Rebooking**
- Impact: Moderate (Convenience, user retention)
- Effort: Low to Moderate
- Reason: Simplifies the rebooking process, especially for frequent users, leading to higher engagement.

5. **Advanced Analytics for Service Providers**
- Impact: Moderate (Provider satisfaction, service quality)
- Effort: Moderate to High
- Reason: Gives service providers valuable insights to improve their services, leading to better overall user satisfaction.

### Low Priority
These features are more specialized or advanced and can be considered for future iterations of the app once the core functionality is robust.

1. **Video Consultation**
- Impact: Moderate (Enhances communication, especially for complex services)
- Effort: High
- Reason: While valuable, this feature may be more relevant to niche services and requires significant development effort.

2. **Dynamic Pricing**
- Impact: Moderate (Maximizes revenue)
- Effort: High
- Reason: Useful for peak times but complex to implement and might be confusing for users if not done carefully.

3. **Task Tracking and Reporting**
- Impact: Moderate (Transparency, user satisfaction)
- Effort: Moderate to High
- Reason: Adds value for customers tracking long-term or complex projects, but it’s less critical for simple or one-time services.

4. **Emergency Services**
- Impact: Moderate (Addresses urgent needs)
- Effort: Moderate
- Reason: Useful for certain service types, but may not be necessary for all users or services.

5. **Customer Support Integration**
- Impact: Moderate (Improves user support)
- Effort: Moderate
- Reason: While important, this feature can be implemented with simpler methods initially (e.g., email support) and expanded later.
